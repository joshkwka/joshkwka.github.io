                  <h4 id="trigger-">Objective:</h4>
                <p>In my 4th year Machine Design course at the University of Toronto, I was tasked with designing a portable, lightweight kayak or small boat carrier 
                  optimizing strength-to-weight ratio, durability, and cost-effectiveness for ease of transport and user comfort. This carrier was estimated to travel 
                  at 4km/h, and was required to be able to carry a 100kg kayak.</p>

                  <h4 id="trigger-">Initial Design:</h4>
                <p>Inspired by the RAD Sportz Premium Aluminum Kayak Cart, featuring a main bar and support bar made of bent pipes, 
                  with simplifications for modeling purposes. Material choices were guided by industry standards and our design goals. 
                  6061 aluminum T6, known for its lightweight and strong material properties, was chosen for the pipe structure. 304 
                  stainless steel was selected for the fasteners due to its strength and corrosion resistance, crucial for water exposure. 
                  My design The design weighs 2.53kg, lighter than the reference design's 4.1kg.

                <p>SolidWorks was used to simulate forces on the carrier while hitting a curb at 4km/h, 
                  identifying significant stress and deflection points. The setup considered various physical factors like gravity, 
                  friction, and the kayak's weight. It should be noted that due to software restrictions, the kayak carrier was fixed parallel 
                  to the ground profile; in reality, this angle would depend on the height of the user.
                  Through this study, it was found that the members with highest risk of failure would be the main bar, and Fastener B.

                <p>The main bar was analyzed for the following failure modes: 
                  <br>
                  (1) Stress along the horizontal portion of the bar
                  <br>
                  (2) Deflection along the horizontal portion of the bar
                  <br>
                  (3) Buckling on the vertical section of the bar
                  <br>
                  (4) Fatigue due to the maximum bending stress
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p>Fastener B was analyzed for the following failure modes: 
                  <br>
                  (1) Bending stress on the pin
                  <br>

                <p> FEA was conducted to assess Von-Mises stress, deflection, 
                  and fatigue stresses on the critical members. The fatigue life cycle was estimated at 360 cycles. 
                  This life cycle assumes the carrier is being 
                  utilized to and from the water each day of the 90-day manufacturer return policy.

                <p>ANSYS offers advanced FEA capabilities, and allows us to analyze the membersâ€™ strength against certain types of 
                  failure. Analytical calculations, based on free body diagrams (FBD), provide a fundamental understanding of the carrier's 
                  mechanical behavior, ensuring a comprehensive analysis when cross-referenced with FEA data. This combination of analytical 
                  and computational methods enhances the reliability of our design assessments, and simplifies iteration against failure. 
                  Analytical calculations are displayed at the bottom of this page.

                      <li>Extensive motion, FEA, and analytical analyses identified the main bar and Fastener B as critical due to high stress and deflection under load.</li>
                      <li>Established a desired minimum FOS of 2, considering material properties, operational environment, and model simplifications.</li>
                      <li>The main bar's initial Von-Mises FOS was 1.45 in FEA and 1.69 analytically.</li>
                      <li>The main bar's fatigue FOS was analytically calculated to be 1.80.</li>
                      <li>Fastener B had an FOS of 2.33 in FEA and 1.50 analytically, with differences attributed to support constraints and analysis methods.</li>
                      <li>Fastener B's fatigue FOS was analytically calculated to be 3.37 due to the material's higher resistance to fatigue</li>

                  <h4 id="trigger-">Design Modifications for Improvement:</h4>
                  <p> Considering the low Von-Mises safety factors, the design could be improved by increasing the cross-sectional area of the pipe and fastener. This 
                      would reduce the stresses due to bending and torsion, thus improving FOS. 
                      By reducing the nominal stress on the parts, the fatigue FOS would also improve. Additionally, material reselection could improve overall 
                      performance. The Von-Mises FOS could be improved by utilizing a material with a higher tensile yield strength, and the fatigue FOS could be improved with 
                      a higher ultimate tensile strength.</p>
