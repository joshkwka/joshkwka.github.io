title: "Veoneer: ECU Module Opening Station"
---

During my internship at Veoneer, I was tasked with developing a CNC module opening station to access testing points on the PCB of a new Electronic Control Unit (ECU) product. Unlike typical ECUs, this new module was fully sealed to protect against water ingress, presenting a significant challenge in accessing its internal components.

## Problem Statement

The existing CNC machine was primarily allocated for brake module troubleshooting, necessitating that the ECU module opening process be scheduled around this priority. Additionally, the ECU required a unique fixture, leading to time-consuming changeovers and potential delays.

## Initial Approach

My initial strategy involved cutting the metal baseplate of the ECU using the CNC machine. However, this approach faced several challenges:

- **Contamination Risk**: Metal shavings from the cutting process posed a threat to the PCB's integrity.
- **Complex Cutting Requirements**: The need for multiple cuts along the plastic housing to remove the baseplate increased the complexity.
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: The CNC machine's availability was limited due to its primary use for brake module troubleshooting.

To address these issues, I implemented the following solutions:

- **Fixture Modification**: Designed a fixture compatible with both ECU and brake modules to streamline changeovers.
- **Tooling Adjustments**: Utilized a longer router bit to accommodate the new fixture design, minimizing the need for frequent tool changes.
- **G-Code Optimization**: Modified the G-Code to perform multi-sweep cuts, reducing the risk of bit breakage.

## Final Design

Recognizing the limitations of the CNC-based approach, I explored alternative solutions that did not rely on the CNC machine. After consulting with project leads and industrial engineers, I developed a manual process using a sonic cutter and a putty knife. This method offered several advantages:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminated the need for CNC machine time, reducing operational costs.
- **Process Flexibility**: Removed scheduling conflicts and allowed for on-demand module opening.
- **Simplicity**: Provided a straightforward solution better suited to the task's low frequency.

## Key Learnings

This project underscored the importance of:

- **Adaptability**: Embracing new skills and software to overcome unforeseen challenges.
- **Holistic Problem-Solving**: Considering multiple perspectives to develop effective solutions.
- **Ownership**: Taking responsibility for projects and proactively seeking improvements.
- **Openness to Alternatives**: Being willing to pivot strategies when initial approaches prove impractical.

By integrating these principles, I successfully developed a cost-effective and efficient solution for accessing the sealed ECU modules, enhancing the testing process's overall effectiveness.
