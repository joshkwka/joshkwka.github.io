This project involves the development and implementation of an **autonomous TurtleBot** capable of exploring and mapping an unknown environment. The key features of the project include:

- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Used **GMapping** for accurate mapping.
- **Robot Platform**: Utilized an **iClebo Kobuki base** equipped with:
  - Bumper sensors
  - Cliff sensors
  - Kinect RGB camera and depth sensors.
- **Environment Constraints**: Explored a **4.87 x 4.87 mÂ²** area with obstacles, completing the task autonomously within **8 minutes**.

## Key Findings

- **DFS Algorithm**:
  - Structured exploration allowed efficient coverage, but occasional inaccuracies occurred due to sensor drift.
- **Randomized Exploration**:
  - Improved coverage of unexplored areas by adding random movements during the final 2 minutes.
- **Precise Navigation**:
  - Adjusted sensory feedback and control responses enabled effective obstacle avoidance and navigation.
